# google_project    
     
This is the google project that I suggested in the zero to mastery community, for which people should find a programming buddy and work in pairs ! The goal is to make a google clone that at least resembles google. It doesn't have to be perfect ! And it doesn't have to implement all the functionalities of the google homepage ! Heavily inspired by the Odin Project. XD
